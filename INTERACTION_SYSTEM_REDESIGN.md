# Interaction Logging System: Redesign for Clarity

## The Problem with Current System

**Current Flow:**
1. Select Mode: "One-on-One" / "Group Flow" / "Celebration" / etc. (6 options)
2. Select Activity: "Coffee" / "Meal" / "Walk" / etc. (6 options per mode = 36 total)
3. Add details

**Issues:**
- 🤔 **Cognitive overhead**: "Is coffee one-on-one or cozy-time?"
- 🔄 **Redundancy**: Coffee, Tea Time, Drink all essentially = "had drinks together"
- 📱 **Too many taps**: 2 screens before getting to the substance
- 🎯 **Mode confusion**: "Quick Touch" mode contains activities like "Quick Visit" - is that the mode or the activity?

---

## New System: Universal Interaction Types + Contextual Tags

### Core Principle
**Log the WHAT quickly, capture the WHY through reflection**

Instead of:
- Mode (how) → Activity (what) → Details (when/notes)

We have:
- **Interaction Type (what)** → **Contextual Reflection (how/why)** → Details (when/vibe)

---

## Proposed Interaction Types (Refined)

### Category 1: Quick Connection 💬
**For maintaining baseline connection with low effort**

#### Text/Call
- **Icon:** 💬
- **Examples:** Text, DM, Voice Note, Phone Call, Video Call
- **Base Score:** 8-15 points
- **When to log:** Quick check-ins, brief exchanges, staying in touch
- **Reflection Prompts:**
  - "What did you chat about?"
  - "What made you reach out?"
  - "How did this brighten your day?"

#### Voice Note
- **Icon:** 🎤
- **Examples:** Voice message, audio message
- **Base Score:** 12 points
- **When to log:** Sent/received audio message
- **Reflection Prompts:**
  - "What did you want to share?"
  - "What tone or feeling came through?"

---

### Category 2: Quality Time 🕰️
**For meaningful presence and connection**

#### Meal/Drink
- **Icon:** 🍽️
- **Examples:** Coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, tea
- **Base Score:** 20-25 points
- **When to log:** Any food/drink-centered hangout
- **Reflection Prompts:**
  - "What did you talk about over {meal}?"
  - "What made this meal time special?"
  - "What flavors or moments do you remember?"
- **Archetype Variations:**
  - **Empress:** "What nourishment - physical or emotional - did you share?"
  - **High Priestess:** "What truth emerged over tea/coffee?"
  - **Sun:** "What energy filled the table?"

#### Hangout
- **Icon:** 🌿
- **Examples:** Hanging out at home, walking together, shopping, casual time, being together
- **Base Score:** 18-22 points
- **When to log:** General unstructured time together
- **Reflection Prompts:**
  - "What did you do together?"
  - "What made this time feel easy/natural?"
  - "What moment stood out?"
- **Archetype Variations:**
  - **Hermit:** "How did the quiet spaces deepen your bond?"
  - **Fool:** "What playfulness emerged?"
  - **Empress:** "What comfort or coziness did you create?"

#### Deep Talk
- **Icon:** 💭
- **Examples:** Heart-to-heart, vulnerable conversation, meaningful discussion
- **Base Score:** 25-30 points
- **When to log:** Conversations that went beyond surface-level
- **Reflection Prompts:**
  - "What truth was shared?"
  - "What did you learn about {name}?"
  - "What vulnerable thing was revealed?"
- **Archetype Variations:**
  - **High Priestess:** "What sacred truth emerged beneath the words?"
  - **Lover:** "What intimacy deepened between you?"
  - **Hermit:** "What wisdom came through in the quiet?"
  - **Magician:** "What vision or possibility did you explore?"

**Special Note:** Deep Talk is a **quality marker** - it can happen during a meal, a walk, or at home. It's about the **depth of conversation**, not the setting.

## Scoring System Updates

### Base Scores by Type:

```typescript
const BASE_SCORES = {
  'text-call': 10,
  'voice-note': 12,
  'meal-drink': 22,
  'hangout': 20,
  'deep-talk': 28,
  'event-party': 27,
  'activity-hobby': 25,
  'celebration': 32,
  'acts-of-care': 30,
};
```

### Tag Multipliers:

```typescript
const TAG_MULTIPLIERS = {
  'deep-talk': 1.3,      // Significantly boosts score
  'vulnerable': 1.25,     // Emotional depth matters
  'acts-of-care': 1.3,    // Support is highly valued
  'one-on-one': 1.1,      // Intimate time bonus
  'group-hangout': 0.9,   // Dilution factor
  'first-time': 1.2,      // Novelty bonus (Fool loves this)
  'spontaneous': 1.15,    // Unplanned connection
  'long-overdue': 1.1,    // Reconnection bonus
};
```

### Archetype Adjustments:

```typescript
const ARCHETYPE_TYPE_MULTIPLIERS = {
  HighPriestess: {
    'deep-talk': 1.5,      // Loves meaningful conversation
    'meal-drink': 1.2,     // Values intimate meals
    'event-party': 0.6,    // Draining
  },
  Sun: {
    'celebration': 1.6,    // Thrives on milestones
    'event-party': 1.5,    // High energy events
    'deep-talk': 0.9,      // Less focus on depth
  },
  Hermit: {
    'deep-talk': 1.4,
    'hangout': 1.3,        // Values quiet time
    'event-party': 0.5,    // Very draining
  },
  // ... etc
};
```

### Final Score Calculation:

```typescript
function calculateWeaveScore(
  type: InteractionType,
  vibe: Vibe,
  tags: string[],
  archetype: Archetype,
  duration?: Duration
): number {
  let score = BASE_SCORES[type];

  // Vibe multiplier
  score *= VIBE_MULTIPLIERS[vibe];

  // Archetype type preference
  score *= ARCHETYPE_TYPE_MULTIPLIERS[archetype][type] || 1.0;

  // Tag bonuses
  tags.forEach(tag => {
    score *= TAG_MULTIPLIERS[tag] || 1.0;
  });

  // Duration modifier (if provided)
  if (duration) {
    score *= DURATION_MODIFIERS[duration];
  }

  return Math.round(score);
}
```

**Example:**
- Type: `meal-drink` (22 pts)
- Vibe: `FullMoon` (1.3x)
- Tags: `deep-talk` (1.3x), `one-on-one` (1.1x)
- Archetype: `HighPriestess` (meal-drink: 1.2x)
- **Total:** 22 × 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.1 × 1.2 = **49 points**

Compare to:
- Type: `text-call` (10 pts)
- Vibe: `WaxingCrescent` (1.0x)
- No tags
- **Total:** 10 points

**Deep meaningful meals matter way more than quick texts** - the system reflects reality.

## Reflection Prompt Matrix

### Structure:

```typescript
interface ReflectionPrompt {
  type: InteractionType;
  archetype?: Archetype;
  vibe?: Vibe;
  tags?: string[];
  prompts: {
    primary: string;
    followUp?: string[];
  };
}
```

### Examples:

**Meal/Drink × High Priestess × FullMoon:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'meal-drink',
  archetype: 'HighPriestess',
  vibe: 'FullMoon',
  prompts: {
    primary: "What truth emerged over your meal together?",
    followUp: [
      "What did you sense beneath the words?",
      "What sacred moment will you remember?"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Event/Party × Sun × FullMoon:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'event-party',
  archetype: 'Sun',
  vibe: 'FullMoon',
  prompts: {
    primary: "What moment of celebration stands out?",
    followUp: [
      "How did you shine together?",
      "What energy filled the room?"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Deep Talk × Any Archetype × FullMoon:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'deep-talk',
  vibe: 'FullMoon',
  prompts: {
    primary: "What truth or insight was shared?",
    followUp: [
      "What did you learn about {name}?",
      "What vulnerable thing was revealed?"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Acts of Care × Empress:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'acts-of-care',
  archetype: 'Empress',
  prompts: {
    primary: "How did you nurture {name} (or they nurture you)?",
    followUp: [
      "What comfort did you offer?",
      "What beauty emerged from this care?"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Users:

**Old Mode → New Type Mapping:**

```typescript
const MIGRATION_MAP = {
  // Old: Mode + Activity → New: Type
  'one-on-one + Coffee': 'meal-drink',
  'one-on-one + Meal': 'meal-drink',
  'one-on-one + Walk': 'hangout',
  'one-on-one + Chat': 'deep-talk',
  'quick-touch + Text': 'text-call',
  'quick-touch + Call': 'text-call',
  'celebration + Birthday': 'celebration',
  'group-flow + Party': 'event-party',
  'out-and-about + Hike': 'activity-hobby',
  // ... etc
};
```

**Tag Auto-Assignment:**
- All "one-on-one" modes → Add `#OneOnOne` tag
- All "celebration" modes → Add `#Celebration` tag
- Activities like "Chat" → Suggest `#DeepTalk`

---

## Benefits of New System

### For Users:
✅ **Faster logging** - One tap to select type, not two
✅ **Less cognitive load** - "What did we do?" not "How would I categorize this?"
✅ **More flexibility** - Coffee can be quick OR deep, system adapts
✅ **Clearer language** - "Deep Talk" is self-explanatory
✅ **Better memory** - Tags help find moments later

### For The App:
✅ **Simpler codebase** - 8 types instead of 6 modes × 6 activities
✅ **Richer data** - Tags provide nuance without complexity
✅ **Better analytics** - "90% of Deep Talks happen over meals"
✅ **Scalability** - Easy to add new tags without restructuring

---

## Open Questions to Resolve:

### 1. Acts of Care - Needs Refinement

**Current Issues:**
- Too broad? Covers both "brought soup when sick" and "listened during crisis"
- Vague icon (❤️‍🩹 vs ❤️ vs 🤝)
- Overlaps with other types (can happen during hangout, meal, etc.)

**Options:**
1. **Keep as standalone** for significant support moments
2. **Make it a tag** that can apply to any interaction (#ActsOfCare)
3. **Split into two**: "Showing Up" (active support) vs "Being Held" (receiving care)
4. **Rename to "Support"** for clarity

**My Recommendation:** Make it a **premium tag** that can enhance any interaction type:
- Had a meal where you supported them? → `meal-drink` + `#ActsOfCare`
- Called during a crisis? → `text-call` + `#ActsOfCare` + `#Vulnerable`
- This preserves the importance while reducing category bloat

### 2. Duration - Keep or Remove?

**Current:** Quick / Standard / Extended
**Question:** Is this still needed if we have tags like `#QuickCheckIn` or types like `text-call` (inherently quick)?

**Recommendation:** Keep but make it **auto-suggested**:
- `text-call` defaults to Quick
- `meal-drink` defaults to Standard
- User can override if needed

### 3. Voice Note - Own Type or Merged?

**Options:**
1. Merge into `text-call` (they're both quick async communication)
2. Keep separate (voice has more emotional bandwidth)

**Recommendation:** Keep separate with distinct icon 🎤 - voice notes have personality that texts don't.

---

## Next Steps

### To Build the Full Prompt Library:

1. **Create comprehensive prompt matrix** for:
   - 8 interaction types
   - 7 (or 8 with Lover) archetypes
   - 5 vibe levels
   - Common tag combinations

2. **Define fallback hierarchy**:
   - Type + Archetype + Vibe (most specific)
   - Type + Archetype (archetype-aware)
   - Type + Vibe (quality-aware)
   - Type only (universal fallback)

3. **Build tag detection logic**:
   - Keyword scanning
   - Context analysis
   - Auto-suggestions

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Build the complete TypeScript prompt library file
- **B)** Refine "Acts of Care" as a tag vs type
- **C)** Create the migration script for existing data
- **D)** Design the new interaction form UI mockups

This redesign is **much clearer** and will make Weave more intuitive while preserving depth through reflections. Great instinct! 🎯

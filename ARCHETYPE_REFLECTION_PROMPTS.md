The current archetypes beautifully cover many relational modes, but **romantic partners, deeply intimate friendships, and emotionally vulnerable bonds** deserve their own recognition. The Lover archetype would:

- Honor the unique weight of partners, soulmates, chosen family
- Value tenderness, devotion, and heart-centered connection

**Suggested Algorithm Adjustments:**
- **Higher decay rate** (like Emperor) - romantic bonds need consistent tending
- **Rewards deep one-on-one time** (meals, home time, meaningful conversation)
- **Bonus for vulnerability markers** (if we add emotion tags)
- **Quality > Quantity** - a single deeply intimate moment > many surface interactions

## Reflection as Ritual

The archetype system transforms reflection from generic note-taking into a **ritual of honoring relational diversity**. Each friend requires different questions because each friendship has a different **soul**.

When Emma reflects on coffee with Sarah (High Priestess), she's asked about **truth and depth**.
When she reflects on a party with Marcus (Sun), she's asked about **joy and radiance**.
When she reflects on a project with Kai (Magician), she's asked about **creation and possibility**.

This teaches users to **see their friends more clearly** - to appreciate that different people feed different parts of our soul, and all of it matters.

That's the magic of the archetype-aware reflection system.

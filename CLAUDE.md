## 1. Project Overview

### Vision & Purpose

Weave is a **mindful relationship companion** designed to combat loneliness, social isolation, and burnout in the modern age. We are not building another social network. Instead, we are creating a private, intelligent tool that helps people deepen the quality of their most important friendships with intention and awareness.

Our vision is to pioneer a new category of digital wellness focused on **social health**. In an era of superficial digital interactions, Weave helps users move from passive, reactive socializing to proactive, meaningful connection. It's a private sanctuary that makes the invisible ebb and flow of relationships visible and actionable, transforming the mental chore of "keeping in touch" into a calm and rewarding ritual.

### Target Audience

We are building Weave for **Millennial and Gen Z urban professionals**.

This audience lives at the intersection of two conflicting realities: they manage busy, complex social calendars while being the generations most acutely feeling the effects of loneliness and social burnout. They value deep, authentic connections but lack the mental bandwidth to consistently nurture them.

Weave acts as a **"second brain" for relationships**, alleviating the guilt of letting time slip by and providing a structured, gentle framework to invest limited social energy where it matters most.

## 2. Core Frameworks

Weave's architecture is grounded in established science and enriched with an intuitive, qualitative layer.

### Dunbar's Layers (The Scientific Foundation)

The app's structural backbone is derived from anthropologist Robin Dunbar's **Social Brain Hypothesis**. This provides a scientifically-validated framework for prioritizing social energy:

| Layer | Size | Description | Decay Rate |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Inner Circle** | ~5 | Core support system | ~2.5 pts/day |
| **Close Friends** | ~15 | Cherished, important bonds | ~1.5 pts/day |
| **Community** | ~50 | Meaningful acquaintances | ~0.5 pts/day |

This structure informs the entire intelligence engine, tailoring insights and reminders based on the distinct needs of each relational layer.

### Tarot Archetypes (The Intuitive Soul)

While Dunbar's Number provides quantitative structure, our **7 Tarot Archetypes** provide the qualitative, intuitive soul. This symbolic language defines the unique energetic dynamic of each friendship, allowing the intelligence layer to offer emotionally intelligent insights.

| Archetype | Energy | Affinity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **The Sun** | Celebration, shared joy | Group activities, events |
| **The Hermit** | Quality one-on-one time | Deep conversations, slower decay |
| **The Emperor** | Structure, mutual respect | Consistency, scheduled meetups |
| **The Fool** | Spontaneity, adventure | Novel experiences, surprises |
| **The Empress** | Nurturing, care | Acts of support, thoughtful gestures |
| **The Magician** | Creativity, collaboration | Projects, brainstorming |
| **The High Priestess** | Depth, intuition | Meaningful conversation, emotional support |

## 4. Architecture Overview

The project uses a **Modular Architecture** where features are encapsulated in `src/modules/` and shared code resides in `src/shared/`.

### Modular Structure (`src/modules/`)

Each module contains its own components, services, stores, and utilities. Cross-module communication happens via the public API (exported from `index.ts`) or the Event Bus.

**Key Modules:**
- `relationships`: Friend management, profiles, image handling
- `interactions`: Weave logging, planning, suggestions
- `intelligence`: Scoring logic, decay, resilience, social season (pure business logic)
- `gamification`: Badges, achievements, streaks
- `insights`: Analytics, portfolio analysis, effectiveness scoring
- `auth`: User profile, settings, background sync
- `reflection`: Weekly reflection, contextual prompts
- `notifications`: Push notifications, reminders
- `groups`: Group weave management

**Shared Code (`src/shared/`):**
- `components`: Generic UI components
- `ui`: Design system primitives (Button, Text, Card, Icon, Input)
- `theme`: Design tokens and theme configuration
- `services`: Global services (Analytics, AppState)
- `utils`: Generic utilities, constants, helper functions
- `types`: Global type definitions

### Database Layer (WatermelonDB)

**Primary Models** (`src/db/models/`):
- `Friend`: Core user relationship data with intelligence fields
- `Interaction`: Logged or planned interactions with friends
- `InteractionFriend`: Many-to-many join table
- `LifeEvent`: Significant events for friends
- `Intention`: User intentions/goals for relationships

**Schema** (`src/db/schema.ts`):
- Snake_case column names in schema, camelCase in models
- Controlled via migrations in `src/db/migrations/`

### Intelligence Engine (`src/modules/intelligence/`)

The core scoring logic. **This is the brain of the application.**

**Key Services**:
- `ScoringService`: Calculates points for new interactions considering archetype, duration, vibe, and group size
- `DecayService`: Applies time-based decay to weave scores based on tier and resilience
- `ResilienceService`: Adjusts decay resistance based on interaction quality
- `SocialSeasonService`: Determines the user's social phase (Resting, Balanced, Blooming)

### State Management

**Zustand Stores** (inside modules):
- Stores manage UI state and wrap service calls
- They often subscribe to WatermelonDB observables or React Query hooks
- Examples: `useRelationshipsStore`, `useInteractionsStore`

**React Query**:
- Used for complex derived data or expensive calculations that don't fit well into WatermelonDB's observable pattern

### Navigation Structure (`app/`)

File-based routing via expo-router:
- `(tabs)`: Main tab navigation (Dashboard, Calendar, Settings)
- `friend-profile.tsx`: Individual friend detail view
- `weave-logger.tsx`: Log interaction flow
- `global-calendar.tsx`: Calendar view
- `_layout.tsx`: Root layout with providers

### Design System (`src/shared/ui/` & `src/shared/theme/`)

**Shared UI Components:**
- `Text`: Typography component with variant support
- `Button`: Primary interaction element (solid, outline, ghost variants)
- `Card`: Container component
- `Icon`: Lucide icon wrapper
- `Input`: Form input component

**Design Tokens** (`src/shared/theme/tokens.ts`):
- Color palette (light/dark themes)
- Typography scales
- Spacing system
- Border radius values

**Styling Strategy**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) is the primary styling engine. All components should use `className` props with Tailwind utility classes mapped to design tokens.

## 5. Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on specific platforms
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npx eslint .

# Clear cache and restart
npm start -- --clear
```

**Note on Native Modules:** If a warning appears about a "native view manager... not being exported":
1. Stop the Metro server
2. Delete the old app build from the device/simulator
3. Run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android` to create a fresh build

## 6. Development Practices

### Working with Modules
- **Encapsulation**: Modules should only export their public API via `index.ts`. **NEVER** import deeply from another module (e.g., `import ... from '@/modules/other/internal/file'`)
- **Feature Logic**: All feature logic belongs in `src/modules/`
- **Shared Helpers**: Generic helpers belong in `src/shared/`
- **Services**: Put business logic in `services/`. Services should be pure functions or stateless classes where possible
- **Stores**: Use Zustand for state
- **Components**: Module-specific components stay within the module

### Working with WatermelonDB
- **Writes**: Always wrap writes in `database.write(async () => { ... })`
- **Observables**: Use `.observe()` for reactive updates
- **Performance**: Use `prepareCreate`/`prepareUpdate` and `batch` for multiple operations

### Styling
- **NativeWind**: Use Tailwind classes for styling via `className` prop
- **Theme**: Use the `useTheme` hook for dynamic colors (light/dark mode)
- **Tokens**: Never hardcode colors or spacing. Use design tokens via Tailwind classes
- **Shared UI**: Prefer `@/shared/ui` components over raw React Native primitives

### Testing
- **Jest**: Run tests with `npm test`
- **Mocks**: WatermelonDB and Native Modules are mocked in `jest.setup.js`
- **Unit Tests**: Co-located in `__tests__` directories within modules

### Linting
- **ESLint**: Run `npx eslint .` to check for issues
- **Strict Mode**: No unused variables, no `any` types (where possible)
- **Imports**: `require` is forbidden in favor of `import` (except in config files)

## 7. Active Initiatives

### UI Standardization (In Progress)

We are currently refactoring the UI layer to eliminate technical debt and establish consistency. See `docs/REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md` for the full plan.

**Goals:**
- Single source of truth for design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` ← `tokens.ts`
- All components use `@/shared/ui` primitives instead of raw React Native components
- Zero `StyleSheet.create` usage; all styling via NativeWind `className`
- "Unsaved Changes" protection in all modals/sheets

**Migration Priority:**
1. Core shared components (Text, Button, Card, Icon)
2. High-usage components (SuggestionCard, ArchetypeCard)
3. Modal components (EditInteractionModal, etc.)

## 8. AI Collaboration Protocol

### Guiding Principles

1. **Understand before acting**
   - Read relevant code before modifying
   - Never propose changes to code you haven't read

2. **Present options**
   - When solving non-trivial problems, present **3 solution approaches** with trade-offs
   - Let the user choose the direction before implementing
   - For trivial fixes (typos, obvious bugs), proceed directly

3. **Scope awareness**
   - Small, contained fixes: proceed and explain
   - Architectural changes or multi-file refactors: outline plan first
   - When uncertain about scope, ask

4. **Preserve intent**
   - Don't over-engineer or add unrequested features
   - A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up
   - Keep solutions simple and focused on the task

5. **Surface trade-offs**
   - Be explicit about pros/cons of approaches
   - Flag potential breaking changes before making them
   - Mention if a change affects other parts of the codebase

6. **Fail fast, communicate clearly**
   - If blocked or uncertain, say so immediately
   - Don't guess at requirements; ask for clarification
   - If you spot a problem, raise it as a proposal

### Example Workflow

**For a bug fix:**
```
1. Read the relevant file(s)
2. Identify the issue
3. If trivial → fix and explain
4. If non-trivial → present 3 approaches, await decision, then implement
```

**For a new feature:**
```
1. Understand the requirement
2. Explore related code for patterns
3. Present 3 implementation approaches with trade-offs
4. After user selection, implement incrementally
5. Surface any discovered issues along the way
```

## 9. Common Gotchas

- **Native Modules**: If you see "WMDatabaseBridge is not defined" in tests, ensure the mock in `jest.setup.js` is correct
- **FlashList**: Use `estimatedItemSize` for performance
- **React Query**: Remember to invalidate queries after mutations if they rely on WatermelonDB data that changed
- **Circular Dependencies**: Use the `Shared` module for common code to avoid cycles between feature modules
- **NativeWind**: Ensure `className` is passed correctly; some RN components don't support it natively
- **Bottom Sheets**: Use `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` components, not raw modals, for slide-up panels
